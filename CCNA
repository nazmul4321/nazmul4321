-------------------------------Node-------------------------------
1. A network node is a connection point that can receive, create, store or send data
2. Network nodes are the physical pieces that make up a network
3.. Any system or device connected to a network is also called a node.

-------------------------------End Point-------------------------------

1. An endpoint is any device that is physically an end point on a network.
2. End point is the point from where typically a communication can be started or ended.
3. Router Switches are intermediary devices.

-------------------------------Client-------------------------------

1. In computing, a client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server as part of the client–server model of computer networks. (Wikipedia)

2. Client that requests for a service and access servieces which is made accessable by a server. 

-------------------------------Server -------------------------------

A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user

-------------------------------Host -------------------------------
A host (also known as "network host") is a computer or other device that communicates with other hosts on a network. Hosts on a network include clients and servers -- that send or receive data, services or applications.

Hosts typically do not include intermediary network devices like switches and routers, which are instead often categorized as nodes. A node is also a broader term that includes anything connected to a network, while a host requires an IP address. In other words, all hosts are nodes, but network nodes are not hosts unless they require an IP address to function.

-------------------------------Protocol-------------------------------
1. A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design. (comptia)

2. Set of rules that defines how to communicate between network devices.

3. Set of rules that defines how computers communicate eachothers.

4. A protocol is a set of rules that governs the communications between computers on a network.

5. Protocol, in computer science, a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers

-------------------------------Port -------------------------------

A port is identified for each transport protocol and address combination by a 16-bit unsigned number, known as the port number. The most common transport protocols that use port numbers are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint. At the software level, within an operating system

Layer 4 (Transport Layer is also responsible for choosing port number )

port number :  suppose you are sending a letter to your friend. There will be a letter box ofcourse outside of your friend house, The letter you are sending that is the applicaiton data, and the post box near to  your friend's house is the port number.

------ Port Numbers ------

Protocols	Name	Numbers
FTP	Tcp	21
SSH	Tcp	22
TELNET	Tcp	23
SMTP	Tcp	25
DNS	TCP/UDP	53
DHCP	UDP	67,68
TFTP	UDP	69
HTTP	TCP	80
HTTPs	TCP	443
POP3	TCP	110
SNMP	UDP	161


Go to the powershell and type

netstat -n 
note: -n is to show the numerical data.

IP Address is like My address
Port Number is like my post box number



----------------- Elements of data transmission -----------------

1. Source
2. Sender
3. Medium
4. Receiver
5. Destination

----------------- Modem ----------------
What is a modem? is it like router?
Ans: No

-Modulate the outgoing data from the computer
-Demodulate the incoming data from the internet

It actally modulates the outgoing data (Digital Signal) of the computer to analog signal
and It also demodulates the incoming analog signal to digital signal.


Suppose you have your phone, computer conncected to internet via your router.
Just imagine,

Your PC/Phone -----> Router -------> Modem (Modulation) ----------> Internet
Your PC/Phone <----- Router <------- Modem (DeModulation) <---------- Internet

Note: The router right now you are using at your home there is a built in switch inside of your router.(One Ethernet port is to  receive the internet and others are used to provide you direct connection through cable, and It also support wireless connection that is why useually you do not use the cable when you are using router at your home.)

----------------- Data Transmission Speed----------------- 
Amount of digital data that is moved from one place to another in a given time
Or you can say that "Bandwidth"

Narrow Band (45 - 300 bps)
Voice Band (upto 9600 bps)
Broadband (More than 1mbps)

----------------- Data Transmission Mode (Direction of Data Communication)----------------- 
1. [Unicast]

- Sender to Receiver Communication
-One to One

-------Unicast Mode-------

Simplex :(One Direction)		A ---------------> B 

Half-Duplex :(One Direction at a time)	 A-------------> B or A <------------- B

Full-Duplex: (Bidirectional at anytime)	 A <-------------> B 

2. Multicast : Casting to a particular/ specific group
3. Broadcast : Casting to all.


--------Different Kinds ----------------------
- Client Server Network
- Peer to Peer Network
- Hybrid Network (Mix of both)

---------Network Topology---------

-Network topology defines the layout, virtual shape, or structure of the network, not only physically but also logically.

Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network.


HUB

- Hub is considered not to be intelligent.
Suppose you have a hub which got 4 ports and they are  connected to 4 devices. 
Device 1 sends a packet through one port of hub, that means this data get copid and will be forwarded through other 3 ports of the HUB.
-This incident not only creates security concern but also produce unnecessary traffic on the network that basically waste of bandwidht. 

SWITCH

- Switch is considered to be intelliegent, it has its mac address table.
Unlike the hub it doesn't do broadcasting all the time, firstly, it checks on its mac address table then if the destination mac address matches with its table mac address then it forwards the traffic to its destination, if doesn't match then it does broadcasting. So data directed only  to the intendended port.
-That reduces unnecessary traffic on the network.
 
Points to be noted in your mind,

1. HUBs and Switches are basically used to exchange data within local area networks.
2. HUBs and L2 switches are not used to send traffic outside of a network.
3. Router is the device that only works with IP addresses, and Router is used to send traffic outside to another network. 
4. HUBs and Switches do not work at IP level. 
5. When any device's traffic needs to travel outside of its own network then it uses the gateway address, and through that it passes out. 
6. You create a local network with hubs and switches.
7. You connect different networks with routers.


Collision Domain Vs Broadcast Domain

-------------- HUB --------------
One collision domain
One broadcast domain
All nodes share the bandwidth of the network
-------------- Switch -------------
Seperate collision domain
Creates a broadcast domain
Gives every conversation the full bandwidth of the network

*********** 4 Different Functions of Router ***********
1. Inter Network Communication (Communicate between different networks)
2. Path Selection (Select the path)
3. Packet Switching (Each router examines and sends each IP packet individually — this is called packet switching.)
4. Packet Filtering (Filter the packet like ACL)

Broadcast Domain------------
The area your broadcast can reach.
Typically a LAN is one Boradcast Domain.

Collision Domain------------
CSMA/CD
Carrier Sense Multiple Access /Collision Detection
CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance) 
-simultaneous data transmissions collide with one another

The algorithm of CSMA/CD is: When a frame is ready, the transmitting station checks whether the channel is idle or busy. If the channel is busy, the station waits until the channel becomes idle. If the channel is idle, the station starts transmitting and continually monitors the channel to detect collision.
